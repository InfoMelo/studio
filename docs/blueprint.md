## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#2E8B57) to convey trust and health. This vivid but grounded color will promote feelings of wellness and security.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to create a clean, neutral backdrop. This provides contrast for content while avoiding a sterile, overly-clinical feel.
- Accent color: Soft Green (#8FBC8F) to highlight important sections and interactive elements. As an analogous color, it will harmonize well with the primary.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet welcoming feel.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use modern, minimalist icons from Material Design to represent different services and facilities.
- Subtle fade-in animations for content sections and transitions.
